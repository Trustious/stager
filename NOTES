abstract 'actions' away so that they can be mixed and matched easily

superuser config option
superuser can do db updates and elasticsearch updates
db/elasticsearch updates brings slots down, disables staging until over

Add more actions: unstage, restage, hotfix/pull, restart server
Hide empty repos during search
preload all branch info
notification on job completion
staging branches from same repo in parallel
push changes and don't restart server

git and trustious user permissions for login and pushing

add instructions and tooltips

port already used fails :( kill whatever is on the port nyahahhahahaha

kill always goes to 15??
  if no such process, it retries and sleeps

Search by real name too??
